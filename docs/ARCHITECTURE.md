# SDK Architecture

## Module Structure

The SDK is a **modular monorepo**:

```
AtatusInternal (shared protocols, types — Foundation only, no external deps)
    ├── AtatusCore (initialization, storage, upload)
    ├── AtatusLogs
    ├── AtatusTrace
    ├── AtatusRUM
    ├── AtatusSessionReplay
    ├── AtatusCrashReporting
    ├── AtatusWebViewTracking
    ├── AtatusFlags
    ├── AtatusProfiling
    └── TestUtilities (test-only, shared mocks/matchers)
```

### Module Boundaries

- Feature modules MUST NOT import each other
- Only `AtatusCore` orchestrates feature lifecycles
- `AtatusInternal` is the ONLY allowed place for shared types — it defines interfaces; `AtatusCore` provides concrete implementations
- Platform support: iOS 12.0+, tvOS 12.0+, macOS 12.6+, watchOS 7.0+ (limited modules), visionOS 1.0+ (limited modules)

### Call Site Synchronization

**When modifying code in feature modules (Logs, Trace, RUM, etc.), you MUST check if any corresponding call sites in `AtatusCore` and `AtatusInternal` need to be updated.**

Common oversights:
- Forgetting to update how `AtatusCore` registers the feature
- Forgetting to update shared types in `AtatusInternal`
- Forgetting to update manual data encoders (`SpanEventEncoder`, `LogEventEncoder`, ...) — new attributes won't be reported
- Forgetting to update ObjC bridges
- Forgetting to update `.pbxproj` files when adding, removing, or moving files

**Always search for usages across the entire codebase before considering a change complete.**

## Data Flow

### RUM Event Emission Pipeline

1. App calls public API (e.g., `RUMMonitor.shared().startView(...)`)
2. `Monitor` (concrete `RUMMonitorProtocol` implementation) creates a `RUMCommand` with timestamp, attributes, user ID
3. Command is enqueued to `FeatureScope` (async serial queue in `AtatusCore`)
4. `FeatureScope` invokes scope hierarchy: `RUMApplicationScope.process()` → `RUMSessionScope.process()` → `RUMViewScope.process()`
5. Each scope decides whether to accept, transform, or reject the command (returns `Bool` — `true` = scope stays open, `false` = scope is closed and removed from parent)
6. If valid, scope serializes to RUM event JSON and calls `writer.write(data:)`
7. `Writer` appends data to in-memory buffer or disk file
8. `DataUploadWorker` periodically reads batches of events from disk
9. `RequestBuilder` wraps batch in HTTP POST to Atatus intake
10. `HTTPClient` sends request; on success files are deleted; on failure backoff/retry applies

### Profiling Pipeline

1. App calls `Profiling.enable(with:in:)` after `Atatus.initialize()`.
2. `ProfilerFeature` registers as a remote feature, configures the native app-launch UserDefaults flags, and installs message receivers for RUM context, RUM payloads, and quota checks.
3. The native Mach profiler samples application threads and aggregates stack traces into pprof data.
4. RUM context provides session IDs and deterministic session sampling; Profiling composes `continuousSampleRate` with the active RUM session sampler for Continuous Profiling.
5. For Custom Profiling, RUM composes `ProfilingOptions(sampleRate:)` with the active session sampler before sending sampled operation payloads to Profiling.
6. RUM payload messages provide TTID, operation, app hang, and long task data for profile correlation.
7. `ProfilingHandler` serializes a `ProfileEvent` plus `wall.pprof` and optional `rum-mobile-events.json` attachments.
8. `RequestBuilder` sends one multipart upload per profile to `/api/v2/profile`.

### Storage Pipeline

```
Feature writes event → AsyncWriter → FileWriter → FilesOrchestrator → disk file
                                                                         ↓
DataUploadWorker (periodic) → DataReader → RequestBuilder → HTTPClient → Atatus backend
```

- File-based storage in Application Support sandbox — no database
- Directory structure: `[AppSupport]/Atatus/[site]/[feature]/`
- Format: JSON for events, binary TLV encoding for compact storage
- Optional encryption via `DataEncryption` protocol
- Caching explicitly disabled at URLSession level (ephemeral config, `urlCache = nil`)
- Key-value storage: `FeatureDataStore` for feature-specific persistent data

### Feature Registration Lifecycle

1. App calls `Atatus.initialize(with:trackingConsent:)` — creates `AtatusCore` instance
2. `AtatusCore` is registered in `CoreRegistry` (singleton lookup)
3. App calls feature-specific `enable()` (e.g., `RUM.enable(with:in:)`)
4. Feature creates its plugin (e.g., `RUMFeature`) and registers with core
5. Core allocates storage directory and upload worker for the feature
6. Feature can now write events and receive messages via the bus

### State Management (Context)

`AtatusContext` is the central context object containing device info, app state, user info, network state, etc. It is built by `AtatusContextProvider` from multiple `ContextValuePublisher` instances that subscribe to system notifications and update context in real-time. Context is passed to every scope during command processing and attached to events before writing.

## Key Abstractions

| Abstraction | Purpose | Examples |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Feature** | Represents a module (RUM, Logs, Trace). Conforms to `AtatusFeature` or `AtatusRemoteFeature`. | `RUMFeature`, `LogsFeature` |
| **Scope** | Hierarchical state container. Implements `process(command:context:writer:)` returning `Bool` (`true` = scope stays open, `false` = scope is closed and removed). | `RUMApplicationScope`, `RUMSessionScope`, `RUMViewScope` |
| **Command** | User action or system event triggering state changes. Struct with timestamp, attributes. | `RUMStartViewCommand`, `RUMAddUserActionCommand` |
| **Storage & Upload** | Persist events and batch-transmit to backend. | `FeatureStorage`, `FileWriter`, `DataUploadWorker` |
| **Context Provider** | Publishes system/app state changes. Implements `ContextValuePublisher`. | `UserInfoPublisher`, `NetworkConnectionInfoPublisher` |
| **Message Bus** | Inter-feature pub/sub communication. Protocol (`FeatureMessageReceiver`) in `TowerSignalInternal/Sources/MessageBus/`; concrete `MessageBus` in `AtatusCore`. | `MessageBus`, `FeatureMessageReceiver` |

## Key Protocols

| Protocol | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `AtatusCoreProtocol` | Central injectable core interface | `TowerSignalInternal/Sources/TowerSignalCoreProtocol.swift` |
| `AtatusFeature` | Base protocol for feature modules | `TowerSignalInternal/Sources/TowerSignalFeature.swift` |
| `AtatusRemoteFeature` | Extension adding `requestBuilder` for features that upload data | `TowerSignalInternal/Sources/TowerSignalFeature.swift` |
| `FeatureScope` | Provides features with event writing, context, and storage | `TowerSignalInternal/Sources/TowerSignalCoreProtocol.swift` |
| `FeatureMessageReceiver` | Receives inter-feature messages via the bus | `TowerSignalInternal/Sources/MessageBus/` |
| `ContextValuePublisher` | Publishes context value changes | `TowerSignalCore/Sources/Core/Context/ContextValuePublisher.swift` |
| `DataEncryption` | Optional encryption for on-disk data | `TowerSignalCore/Sources/Core/Storage/DataEncryption.swift` |

## Message Bus

### Message Types

Inter-feature communication uses `FeatureMessage` (defined in `TowerSignalInternal/Sources/MessageBus/FeatureMessage.swift`):

| Case | When to use |
|------|------------|
| `.context(AtatusContext)` | **Shared state that changes over time.** Broadcast automatically on every context update. Receivers extract what they need from `AtatusContext.additionalContext`. |
| `.payload(Any)` | **One-off events or commands.** Sender explicitly calls `core.send(message: .payload(...))`. Receiver downcasts to the expected type. |
| `.webview(WebViewMessage)` | Browser SDK events from the JS bridge (logs, RUM, telemetry, session replay records). |
| `.telemetry(TelemetryMessage)` | SDK internal telemetry (debug, error, configuration, metric, usage). |

### `.context` Pattern — Reading Shared State

Use this when a feature needs to track another feature's evolving state (e.g., current RUM view, session sampling decision). Context is propagated automatically — no explicit sends required.

**How it works:**
1. A feature sets its context via `featureScope.set(context: { RUMCoreContext(...) })` — this updates `AtatusContext.additionalContext`.
2. Any context change triggers `AtatusCore` to broadcast `.context(atatusContext)` to every registered feature.
3. Receivers extract what they need: `context.additionalContext(ofType: RUMCoreContext.self)`.

**Canonical example** — Session Replay's `RUMContextReceiver` (`TowerSignalSessionReplay/Sources/Feature/RUMContextReceiver.swift`):

```swift
func receive(message: FeatureMessage, from core: AtatusCoreProtocol) -> Bool {
    guard case let .context(context) = message else { return false }
    let new = context.additionalContext(ofType: RUMCoreContext.self)
    if new != previous { onNew?(new); previous = new }
    return true
}
```

Other `.context` receivers: Trace's `ContextMessageReceiver`, `NetworkContextCoreProvider`, `CrashContextCoreProvider`, `WatchdogTerminationMonitor`, `ContextSharingTransformer`.

### `.payload` Pattern — One-Off Events

Use this for discrete events that one feature sends and another consumes — crash reports, error forwarding, flag evaluations.

**Examples:**
- `RemoteLogger` sends `.payload(RUMErrorMessage)` → RUM's `ErrorMessageReceiver` adds a RUM error
- `CrashReportSender` sends `.payload(Crash)` → RUM's `CrashReportReceiver` writes crash error events
- `FatalErrorContextNotifier` sends `.payload(RUMViewEvent)` → `CrashContextCoreProvider` persists the last view for crash reports

### `CombinedFeatureMessageReceiver` — Ordering Matters

`CombinedFeatureMessageReceiver` uses `contains(where:)` — it **short-circuits** after the first receiver returns `true`. Receivers later in the list will not see the message. This is intentional for deduplication but means **ordering of receivers within a feature matters**.

Note: `MessageBus.send()` does NOT short-circuit across features — every registered feature receives every message.

### `RUMCoreContext`

Defined in `TowerSignalInternal/Sources/Models/RUM/RUMCoreContext.swift`. Key fields: `applicationID`, `sessionID`, `viewID`, `userActionID`, `viewServerTimeOffset`, `sessionSampler`. Conforms to `AdditionalContext` (key: `"rum"`) and `Equatable`.

Set by `Monitor.swift` after each command via `featureScope.set(context:)`. Consumed by any receiver that calls `context.additionalContext(ofType: RUMCoreContext.self)`.

## Error Handling

See `docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md` for customer-facing error safety and internal telemetry error reporting conventions.

## Thread Safety Rules

- **`@ReadWriteLock`**: Property wrapper for concurrent read, exclusive write access. Use for shared mutable state.
- **Serial queues**: Scope processing uses serial dispatch queues (`FeatureScope` is serial).
- **No `DispatchQueue.main.sync`**: Forbidden — prevents deadlocks.
- **NSLock exception**: `NSLock` is used in method swizzling code (`TowerSignalInternal/Sources/Swizzling/`, `TowerSignalInternal/Sources/NetworkInstrumentation/`) where low-level synchronization is required — do not refactor those.
- **No thread spawning**: SDK uses system background queues (`qos: .utility`), never creates threads.

## HTTP Upload Details

- **Auth**: Client token passed as `api-key` header
- **Custom headers**: `ATATUS-EVP-ORIGIN`, `ATATUS-EVP-ORIGIN-VERSION`, `ATATUS-REQUEST-ID`
- **Formats**: JSON, NDJSON (batches), multipart/form-data (Session Replay, crashes, profiles)
- **Compression**: Gzip (`Content-Encoding: gzip`)
- **Endpoint**: the single `.atatus` site → `mo-rx.atatus.com`, overridable via `ATATUS_SERVER_URL`
- **Intake paths**: RUM `/v1/ios/rum`, Logs `/v1/ios/logs`, Traces `/v1/ios/spans`; Session Replay `/api/v2/replay`, Profiling `/api/v2/profile`, Flags `/api/v2/exposures`
- **Header builder**: `TowerSignalInternal/Sources/Upload/URLRequestBuilder.swift`
- **Site definitions**: `TowerSignalInternal/Sources/Context/TowerSignalSite.swift`

## Dependencies

- **KSCrash 2.5.0**: Crash detection and reporting (`AtatusCrashReporting`)
- **opentelemetry-swift-core 2.3.0+**: OpenTelemetry API for distributed tracing (`AtatusTrace`).

Avoid adding new dependencies unless absolutely necessary (small footprint principle).
