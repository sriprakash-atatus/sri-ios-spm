// ATCHG: Atatus SDK migration - renamed module imports `ddInternal` -> `AtatusInternal`,
// `ddTrace` -> `AtatusTrace`; renamed `dd*` types to `Atatus*`; renamed the `DD` symbol prefix to
// `AT`; renamed the `_dd` attribute prefix to `_atatus`; repointed the intake host at the Atatus site;
// rebranded the `dd` name to `Atatus` in comments and docs; rebranded the licence header.
