// ATCHG: An e-commerce app built on the agent, used by `.github/workflows/ios-agent-test.yml`.
//
// FlipShop, a marketplace laid out the way Indian shopping apps are: a home feed with search,
// categories, offer banners and deals; search with autocomplete; sortable listings; product pages
// with offers, a pincode delivery check and a wishlist; a cart with quantity steppers and a price
// breakdown off the MRP; a delivery address step; UPI / card / net banking / cash on delivery
// payment; and an order confirmation with a tracking timeline. Prices are in rupees.
//
// The other scenarios call the SDK's manual APIs. This one calls none of them: the store's own code
// (`Scenarios/Ecommerce/Store`) has no SDK imports at all beyond the instrumented `URLSession` it
// creates. Everything that reaches the intake is captured by the agent on its own —
//
//   · RUM views      from the view controllers appearing as the shop walks its funnel
//   · RUM actions    from real taps, through `uiKitActionsPredicate`
//   · RUM resources  from the store's real requests to its backend
//   · Network spans  from the same requests, with trace headers propagated to the backend
//   · Mobile vitals  CPU, memory and refresh rate, sampled while the shop runs
//   · App hangs and frustration signals
//   · Session Replay a recording of the screens
//
// — which makes this the scenario that answers "does the agent report a real app correctly?", as
// opposed to "does each SDK method work?".
//
// Note on Logs: the Logs product has no auto-capture — every log is written by application code, so
// a scenario that reports nothing by hand produces no logs. Logs is still enabled here, so the
// feature is initialized the way a real app would have it, but this scenario is not expected to
// upload log payloads. `TowerSignalDemoScenario` remains the one that exercises the Logs API.
//
// The funnel walks itself (see `ECAutoPilot`), so `simctl launch` alone drives it without a test
// runner. `customEndpoint` is read from the server mock configuration where there is one, so this
// runs against the local mock intake as well as against a real TowerSignal intake, where every feature
// falls back to `TowerSignalSite.serverUrl`.
